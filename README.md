# Fraud-Detection
### Objectives:
* Train an Unsupervised model for fraud detection
* Isolaste fraudulent transcations from legit ones using Isolation Forest
* Flag down fraud transactions <br>
### Overview
Due to increased number of online transactions, consequently there have been a rise in number of online scams and frauds especially through credic card. Thus, it is important to be sure before making any online money transaction whether the transaction is Legit or Fraudulent.
With help of online transaction data, we can write an algorithm that will flag any tansaction suspected to be fraudulent so that customers will be on a safe side.
Using Isolation Forest, I have created an algorithm that is able to perform that task and evaluated its performance with ground truth of transactions already flagged as fraudulent. Fraud transactions were detected and isolated successfully as the below visual using t-SNE dimensionality reduction shows: <br>
